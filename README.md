## Shopping list app with React, Node and Mongoose

**Work in progress.**

Should probably work on localhost without tweaking (needs mongodb on localhost).


First, make sure you have mongod up an running on localhost.


Run `npm install`
Run `npm start` at root folder to start the server.
Then at /client, run `npm start` again.
Open localhost:3000 on your web browser.



#### Known Issues
    +server crashes if first mongodb connection fails


#### To Do
    +authenticating
    +error handling
