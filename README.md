## Shopping list app with React, Node and Mongoose

**Work in progress.**

Should probably work on localhost without tweaking (needs mongodb on localhost).


First, make sure you have mongod up an running on localhost.


1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` at root folder to start the server.
3. At `/client`, run `npm start` again.
4. Open `localhost:3000` on your web browser.



#### Known Issues
    + server crashes if first mongodb connection fails


#### To Do
    + authenticating
    + error handling
